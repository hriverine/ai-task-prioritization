# Project Charter: AI-Powered Task Prioritization Tool

## 🎯 Project Objective
To develop an AI-driven tool that enables project managers to intelligently prioritize tasks and milestones based on urgency, complexity, and impact. The goal is to help PMs focus on the most critical activities that could affect project timelines and delivery success. The system will provide AI-generated scoring to support faster, data-informed decision-making across projects.

## 📦 Scope
This MVP includes:
- A basic user interface for PMs to input task data (title, urgency, impact, effort)
- A rule-based or AI-mocked logic to generate a priority score for each task
- A visual display of prioritized tasks sorted by score
- Timeline awareness (indicating tasks due soon or overdue)
- Documentation of project management processes using Agile methodology
- Dashboard/reporting using Power BI (mocked or sample)

Out of scope: Integration with real PM tools (like MS Project), live database or automation for notifications

## ⏳ Timeline
- **Week 1**: Project planning, backlog setup, UI/logic design
- **Week 2**: Sprint 1 – UI and scoring logic implementation
- **Week 3**: Sprint 2 – Output display, enhancements, timeline logic
- **Week 4**: Final review, stakeholder demo, documentation packaging

## 👥 Roles & Responsibilities
- **Project Manager**: Rishab Karmakar — Responsible for planning, Agile delivery, backlog grooming, and stakeholder management
- **AI Developer**: Simulated — Implements priority scoring logic (rule-based or GPT-assisted)
- **UI/UX Designer**: Simulated — Designs input form and output layout using Figma
- **Stakeholders**:
  - PMO team — End users
  - Sponsor — Internal innovation or tooling sponsor (simulated)
  - Program Manager — Interested in task insights and delivery optimization

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **GitHub** – Code repository and documentation
- **JIRA** – Agile board and sprint tracking
- **Power BI** – Dashboards for task metrics and KPIs
- **Figma** – UI mockups for the input and results screen

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Functioning MVP with task input, AI scoring logic, and sorted priority output
- Clean and usable UI
- Traceable Agile artifacts: backlog, sprint plan, review notes
- Basic dashboard/report showing task spread and urgency profile
